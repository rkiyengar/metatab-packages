Column,strata_level_name,text,,Levels of the strata,15.0,"Day care center (serving children ages 2 to 5), Infant center (serving children ages 0 to 2)"
Column,facility_capacity,number,,Number of licensed infant center slots (serving children ages 0 to 2) or number of licensed day care center slots  (serving children ages 2 to 5),double prec.,
Column,total_pop,number,,"If strata level is ""Infant center,"" the total_pop is the total number of children ages 0 to 2 years; if strata level is ""Day care center,"" total_pop is the total number of children ages 2 to 5.",double prec.,
Column,rate_slots,number,,"Number of licensed infant center or day care center slots per 1,000 children population",double prec.,
Column,LL95CI_percent,number,,Lower limit of 95% confidence interval,double prec.,"Lower limit of 95% confidence interval.  The 95% confidence limits depict the range within which the percentage would probably occur in 95 of 100 sets of data (if data similar to the present set were independently acquired on 100 separate occasions). In five of those 100 data sets, the percentage would fall outside the limits."
Column,UL95CI_percent,number,,Upper limit of 95% confidence interval,double prec.,Upper limit of 95% confidence interval.
Column,se,number,,Standard error,double prec.,The standard error (SE) of the mean is a measure of the precision of the sample mean.  The standard error falls as the sample size increases. (Reference: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1255808/)
Column,rse,number,,Relative standard error (se/rate) expressed as a percent,double prec.,"The relative standard error (RSE) provides the rational basis for determining which rates may be considered “unreliable.” Conforming to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) standards, rates that are calculated from fewer than 20 data elements, the equivalent of an RSE of 23 percent or more, are considered unreliable (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/ohir/Documents/OHIRProfiles2014.pdf).  For this project we consider estimates with RSE ≥ 30% as unreliable."
Column,CA_decile,integer,,California decile,integer,"'ca_decile' groups places into 10 groups (or deciles) according to the distribution of values of the rate. Highest rate values are included in the first decile.  Equal values or 'ties' are assigned the mean decile rank. For example, in a database of 100 records where 70 records equal 0, 0 values span from the 1st to 7th deciles (70% of all data records). As a result, all 0 values will be assigned to the 4th decile: the mean between the 1st and 7th deciles.  The deciles are only calculated for places."
Column,CA_RR,number,,Rate ratio to California rate (relative risk),double prec.,Ratio of local percentage to regional rate. This indicates how many times the local rate is higher or lower than the state rate (Reference: http://health.mo.gov/training/epi/RateRatio-b.html). Values higher than 1 indicate local rates are higher than regional rates.
Column,no_facility,integer,,Number of licensed daycare facility,integer,This variable was added to serve as reference for those who wish to examine the number of daycare centers available at different geographical levels.
Column,pct_nonwhite,number,,Percent of nonwhite children ages 0 to 5,double prec.,This variable was added to serve as reference for those who wish to examine the rate of daycare center availability with non-White children population at different geographical levels.
