Data Packages in Metatab format

This repository holds [Metatab](http://metatab.org) files for data packages for which we don't control the data -- all of the resource URLs are off site. You can use the metatab files to create local data packages with the [metapack](https://github.com/CivicKnowledge/metapack) application.
